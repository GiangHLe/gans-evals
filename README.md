# Precision and recall score for Pytorch

According on paper [Improved Precision and Recall Metric for Assessing Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08500) and [author's official repo](https://github.com/kynkaat/improved-precision-and-recall-metric), I build this repo to make it easier to use Precision and Recall.
